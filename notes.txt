1. .gitignore: 
		All file names need to add to .gitinore file before commit them. 
		Otherwise they will be appear in public repository in GitHub

2. SSH: 
	issue: 
		Every time when i try to perform "push" command remote server asks my credentials. 
		But SSH-key already exist.

	solution:
		Modified GIT configuration file. Changed SSH connection string in ~/.git/config 
				
				from 

		url = https://github.com/path/to/repository  
			
				to

		url = ssh://git@github.com/path/to/repository
